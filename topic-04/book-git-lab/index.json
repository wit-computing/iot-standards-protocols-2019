To do this, open the Terminal application from spotlight and type `git`. This will prompt Git to install the rest of the command line tools for Git. This should only take a few minutes. It will ask if you would like to download Xcode, which you can ignore.\r\n\r\n####Linux\r\n\r\nYou can use the basic package-management tool that comes with your distribution. For Fedora use:\r\n\r\n``$ sudo yum install git-all``\r\n\r\nFor Debian-based distributions use:\r\n\r\n``$ sudo apt-get install git-all``\r\n\r\n"
